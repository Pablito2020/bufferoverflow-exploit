# Buffer Overflow Exploit

## Usage:
First, clone the project (THE DIRECTORY IS IMPORTANT FOR CALCULATING THE RETURN VALUE, SO PLEASE, FOLLOW THIS INSTRUCTIONS):

```bash
    $ cd /home/user # the username is important, for now only "user" is tested
    $ git clone git@github.com:Pablito2020/bufferoverflow-exploit.git practica
    $ cd practica
```

Then, install the binaries and disable some stack protections:
```bash
    $ sudo make install
```

Finally, run the exploit (if 70 isn't enough, try different numbers or create a loop that tries from 20 to 200):
```bash
    $ ./exploit 70
```

## Additional information
If you want to see how you can overflow the version that uses puts instead of printf (which was disabled with the *-fno-builtin-printf* flag), you can check out the "gdb-only" branch.
