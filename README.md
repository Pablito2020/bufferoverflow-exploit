# Buffer Overflow Exploit
For now, the buffer overflow only works with the help of GDB (which we use for ignoring the SIGSEGV signals).
If you want to see the buffer overflow running without gdb and withuot any limitations, see the [master branch](https://github.com/Pablito2020/bufferoverflow-exploit).

## Usage:
First, clone the project (THE DIRECTORY IS IMPORTANT FOR CALCULATING THE RETURN VALUE, SO PLEASE, FOLLOW THIS INSTRUCTIONS):

```bash
    $ cd /home/user # the username is important, for now only "user" has been tested
    $ git clone git@github.com:Pablito2020/bufferoverflow-exploit.git -b gdb-only practica
    $ cd practica
```

Then, install the binaries and disable some stack protections:
```bash
    $ sudo make install
```

Finally, run the exploit:
```bash
    $ ./exploit.sh
```

## Limitations:
Since we are using GDB for ignoring the SIGSEGV signals, we can't scalate privileges from user to root. The solution is to implement ourselves a version of the exploit which ignores this signals and continues the instructions flow.
